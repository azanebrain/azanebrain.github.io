I am an interactive web developer, narrative designer, &amp; community strengthener.

By constantly practicing the crafts of code development &amp; efficient messaging I aim to create engaging experiences that make people reconsider the definition of normal.

By creating opportunities for knowledge sharing in digital &amp; physical communities, I strive to raise the bar of excellence in the interactive dev industry &amp; give people the confidence and skills to push the web forward.

Every day I try to make something cooler than it was before.

I work as a Front End Developer at [Veyo Logistics](https://veyo.com), I organize [Front End Authority](http://FrontEndAuthority.org), and I admin [Advanced WordPress](http://advancedwp.org).

I am [AJ Zane](http://AJZane.com). This is where I log what I'm learning.
