Torque IO Magazine listed me as one of the [top 100 WordPress influencers to watch in 2015](http://torquemag.io/100-wordpress-influencers-follow-2015/).

I feel really honored and super surprised. When [Michael Bastos](http://bastos.me/) posted the article's link on the [AWP group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/), mentioning that 10% of the influencers listed were our members, I was all ready to congratulate my friends for their hard work and contributions. These days I do more JS than WP, so ending up on the list was the last thing I expected.

The past three years have been an incredible journey for me. My first days with WP were a struggle of figuring out why my PHP knowledge didn't work "the WP way". Now I'm able to help my friends and community get individuals online with awesome sites, expand knowledge of how the web works and have a great time doing it. 

2014 has been an awesome year and I'm really excited for the surprises coming in the next 12 months.
