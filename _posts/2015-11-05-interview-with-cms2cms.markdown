[I've been interviewed by CMS2CMS!](https://www.cms2cms.com/blog/migrations-are-wordpress-achilles-heel-interview-with-aj-zane)

They're a pretty cool service that helps migrate CMS' for people (Joomla! to WordPress anyone?). 

Their questions got me thinking about the WP community and how awesome it is. The people who gravitate towards using WordPress seriously are really cool and approachable. I'm glad I've been able to make my way into this group and meet such amazing people.

Also, I might have to add this bio of me to my resume:

> Spare a thought for AJ Zane and you may be left with no less deep impression than the one he made on us: smart, creative, proficient and modest. When he turns up for work each day, there is not much chance to see him relaxedly enjoying tea or contemplating conversations. Luckily, for us this chance today is given. AJ is being an admin of the AdvancedWP Facebook group, has been developing websites for more than 15 years, this guy is a real gem of talent within the community of WordPress. When you have exhausted all possibilities to make your web project even better, remember this: you havenâ€™t. With you we share AJ prime chart of WP plugins and a flash on everything you need to enhance your CMS. Read these things this day below.
