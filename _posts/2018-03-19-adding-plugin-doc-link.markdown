Sometimes you have to crank out a really simple plugin and you don't have time to make a proper documentation panel in the WordPress admin. I think, in this case, it's much easier to maintain documentation on your personal site rather than rolling out document changes with version updates. Remember: This is for a tiny project, or internal team. You don't want to do this for something that'll be reached by a significant amount of real users.

This trick will add a link to your self-hosted documentation within the plugin's description on the Plugins Admin Panel.
